# Serverless Logic App Demo

The Logic App demo is designed to be delivered during the Logic App presenation.  The demo is based off a real-world Logic App implementation, though the data has been changed.

There are two different Logic App demos, one that uses an Integration Account and Liquid template for mapping.  The second demo is simpler and uses a smaller JSON file as well as removes the Integration account.
